# Drive SolarWM's MiniMax-H3 over MIND. Default engine (camera) uses REAL
# camera-conditioned generation: the trained Stage0.5 LoRA adapter +
# h3_camera_infer.py, with each sample's real ws/ad/ud/lr action.json
# converted directly into a [47,4,4] camera trajectory (genuine per-frame
# conditioning, not a text hint). --engine text falls back to the original
# uncoditioned base pipeline + text-paraphrase approach. Writes to
# MIND-tests/solarwm/. Runs through SolarWM's own .venv-h3 venv.
#
# UNTESTED end to end (camera engine) -- see h3_camera_infer.py's own
# docstring for the unverified camera axis/sign caveat, and
# src/drive_solarwm.py's docstring for the full engine comparison. Only
# lcm/visual/dino/avg_mse are trustworthy right now; `action` AND `gsc`
# should be treated as noise until camera-engine output is manually
# inspected and confirmed to follow the intended direction. Score with:
#   run_mind.sh solarwm lcm,visual,dino 1 both
#
# LOAD-ONCE: builds a manifest and makes one --mind-batch call -- the model
# loads once and loops every sample, same idea as drive_abot.sh.
