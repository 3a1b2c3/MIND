# Build MIND's scoring venv (Linux + this box's GPU/CUDA -- see note below).
# Runs staging (drive_*.py) + scoring (process.py). DreamX-World inference is
# cross-spawned in its OWN venv via DREAMX_VENV_PY, so this venv does NOT need
# the DreamX stack. ViPE (action metric) is built separately (see
# setup_mind_evoke.bat's Windows equivalent, or build the venv the same way).
#
# Deviates from setup_mind_venv.bat's cu130 index: that's tuned for the
# Windows box's RTX 5090 (sm_120). This box (pmgb300ws-0304) is a GB300
# (aarch64, CUDA 13.2) -- confirmed earlier the same day (echo_wm's setup)
# that this exact box needs cu132, not cu130/cu128. torch/torchvision left
# unpinned from cu132 rather than guessing an exact version number that may
# not exist on that index (same lesson learned the hard way setting up
# H3-World tonight -- a pinned version can silently not exist on a given
# CUDA index and pip falls back to something wrong instead of erroring).
